* What it the package.json?
is a file that contains things in json format. things means configuration stuff
* In the case of npm this file has to contain some properties.
Example of package.json:
  {
    "name" : "project X"
  }
this define a name property
Another properties could be:
  version,
  description,
  scripts,
  dependencies,
  dev-dependencies
and so on.

In case you want to create a npm package and publish it,
there are some properties you should define in the package.json.

About package-lock.json file
  The package-lock.json sets your currently installed version
  of each package in stone, and npm will use those exact versions
  when running npm install.
This is to avoid version problems when trying to run npm install
 when the repository is cloned and things like that.

About dev-dependencies:
When a package is needed just for development sake (testing, or some transpiler)
must be installed with --save-dev flag or -D, wich means they are going to be
ignored if in production you run npm install --production
